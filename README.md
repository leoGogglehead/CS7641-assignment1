This project implements the following 5 different learning algorithms on two different datasets:

    Decision Tree Classifier
    Neural Networks
    k-nearest neighbors
    Boosting (ADABoost)
    SVM with a rbf kernel function
    SVM with an sigmoid kernel function


## Build
NOTE: MUST HAVE CONDA INSTALLED. 
Run the following commands from directory devenv_conf to set up a minimal conda environment, activate the environment, then install and configure poetry.
- 'conda env create -f environment.yml'
- 'conda activate cs7641_ass1'
